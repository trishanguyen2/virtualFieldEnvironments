# Field Trip

**Field Trip** is a React-based application for building and exploring immersive Virual Field Environments (VFEs). 

Designed for students and educators to simulate the experience of an on-site field excursion. Users can upload panoramic photospheres and embed interactive 
hotspots (such as videos, images, links, and audio). Originally built for environmental education and scientific fieldwork, Field Trip allows students to explore
layered content and investigate real-world environments from any location. 

Ideal for use in K-12 or higher education, this tool supports digital learning, student led projects, and hybrid field experiences.
